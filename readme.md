This repository contains the deliverables to fulfill the requirement to complete the Machine Learning Engineer nano-degree at Udacity and also to build a decision making tool based on machine learning algorithms fed with data containing offers, customer demographics and transactions provided by Starbucks. 

The code for this project was built with public libraries such as scikit learn, numpy, seaborn, etc. There are no private data or libraries.

The data exploration phase can be found in the notebook **data_exploration_engineering.ipynb**.

The feature engineering phase, training, evaluation and conclusions are found in the notebook **Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynb**.

No special configuration or additional steps are necessary.
